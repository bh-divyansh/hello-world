# hello-world
This is me trying to learn Git and GitHub by creating my first ever repository on the online GUI version of GitHub.com
In this rep. (repository, eh?, did I make the correct abbreviation?), there existed 2 branches - one "main" which is currently (and i guess forever...?) our production branch and the second one (which I just created out of curiosity of learning) known as "readme-edits" branch.

Don't know what to write in this edits file, This file will probably first go into readme-edits branch and then I will sooner or later merge this branch with my main (production) branch by making a "pull request" (is that what they call it?) to umm...myself? 

So we have uploaded a complementary #hashtag-learning-a-new-thing story on Instagram and now its time that we move from editing this readme.md file which nobody will ever read (was my assumption wrong, can everybody read this, OH MY GOD!)
